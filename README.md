blendseg
========

A few python files which are helping me to do 3d segmentation in Blender.

*** This is a work in progress. ***

I'm still trying to figure out the Blender API. Currently I'm using Blender 2.63 on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04.3
I tried this with the repository version and the object intersection code did not work.

This is all mostly based on some projects.

The object intersection code is from here:
http://airplanes3d.net/scripts-253_e.xml

I can't remember where I dug up the create-plane-with-image code, but I'll try to find it.
